# RockS.T.A.R

RockS.T.A.R. is an interactive AI chat application for S.T.A.R. (Situation, Task, Action, Result) interviews. Tell RockS.T.A.R. what kind role you are interviewing for and it will ask you relevant question and offer feedback on your answers.

This application uses:

- Python and Flask on the backend.
- The [OpenAI Assistants API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/assistants/overview)
- [HTMX](https://htmx.org/) and Tailwind on the frontend.

## Installation

I used Python 3.12 when writing this application and Poetry for dependency management.

- `poetry install`
- `flask run`
- Go to 127.0.0.1:500/chat
